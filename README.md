# borrowck_examples

Simple examples comparing Rust and C++ to highlight how the borrow checker and other simple features of Rust work.

The included script `build_cpp.sh` requires `g++` to be a valid C++ compiler defined on the user's `PATH`, and must be run from within the repository.

To build/check the Rust examples (which by design do not compile without modifications), you must have Cargo installed - then simply run `cargo check` or `cargo build`.
